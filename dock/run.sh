#   on mac, linux.
# current working folder is exposed inside the docker image
# only the "build" and "node_modules" are separate (since host and docker might have different binary formats)
# for this reason, you must run "yarn" to install all packages again.
# actual build and node_modules are saved under build/dock-build and build/dock-node_modules
# by default, ports 8545, 8090 are forwarded into the docker image (so we can run a relay and ganache inside)
#
#environment variables:
#NO_PORT - disable port forwarding into the docker image.
#VERBOSE - show docker image re-creation (by default, it takes only 1-2 seconds, so we hide it, but after checking
#           out new version it might take longer)
